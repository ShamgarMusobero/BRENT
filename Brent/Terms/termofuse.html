<b>1.Acceptance of the Terms of Use</b>

(“Brent”, “we” or “us”) operates this website and any related smartphone or mobile application (collectively, the “Website” or the “Site”) and the Brent online real estate marketplace, including the “Brent Pro,” “Brent Select,” “Rent Payments” and “Pay Rent” services, offered through the Website (the “Services”). These terms of use are entered into by and between you and Brent. The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, the “Agreement”), govern your access to and use of the Website and the Services, whether as a guest or a registered user.
</p>
<p>
Please read this Agreement carefully before you start to use the Website. By using the Website or the Services, or by clicking to accept or agree to this Agreement when this option is made available to you, you agree to comply with and be bound by this Agreement, our Privacy Policy, found at https://www.Brent.com/privacy-policy, incorporated herein by reference (the "Privacy Policy"), and such other policies and procedures as may be incorporated herein under Section 7 of this Agreement. If the individual clicking to accept or agree to this Agreement is doing so on behalf of an entity and registers such entity with this Website, then you (the individual) represent and warrant that you have authority to bind such entity and enter into this Agreement on its behalf, and all further references to "you" shall be to such entity. If you do not agree to this Agreement or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website or the Services.
</p>
<p>
The Website and the Services are offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older. By using the Website or the Services, you, the user, represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract with Brent and meet all of the eligibility requirements set forth herein. If you do not meet these requirements, you must not access or use the Website or the Services.
</p>
<p>
Each of Brent's service clients may be subject to one or more separate written agreements with Brent or with each other (each, a "Service Agreement"). This Agreement applies only to use of the Website and the Services and in no way affects the terms and conditions of any Service Agreement.
</p>
<b>2. Changes to the Terms of Use</b>
<p>
This version of this Agreement became effective on June 11, 2019 and amends, restates and replaces any version effective prior to such date. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time, with respect to your use of the Website and Services following amendment. Notification of any amendment will be posted on the Website and will be effective immediately. You are under an obligation to review the current version of this Agreement and other Brent policies each time before using the Website or the Services. All amendments are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website and the Services thereafter. Your use of the Website or the Services following any amendment of this Agreement will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms.
</p>
<b>3. Subscription Information; Payment for Certain Services</b>
<p>To subscribe for certain Services and obtain access to password-protected areas of the Website, you must establish a Brent account by providing us with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the online enrollment form and by selecting a password, the confidentiality of which shall be your responsibility. You may not use anyone else’s Brent account in connection with your use of the Services, or permit anyone else to use the Services or to access password-protected areas of the Website using your Brent account. You agree to notify Brent immediately of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Brent account, or any other breach of security.
</p>
<p>
Certain Services may be subject to fees charged by Brent ("Fees") which will be identified at the point of purchase of such Services. Additional functionality and services may be offered or provided by us from time to time and these will be described on the Website. Services requiring Fees which have not been previously agreed upon will be notified to you, and your agreement to be responsible for any such additional Fees will be required, before any such additional Fees will be applied. We will charge your credit card for applicable authorized Fees and you understand that, once charged, such Fees are non-refundable. If Brent does not receive payment from the issuer of the credit card associated with your Brent account, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand directly to Brent, and Brent further reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Brent account and your access to the Services in such circumstances.
</p>
<p>
If you purchase a subscription plan or agree to make recurring automatic payments by enrolling in our “AutoPay” service, your subscription or automatic payments will continue in effect and renew on a recurring basis, monthly or annually, unless and until you cancel your subscription or AutoPay. If you provide a credit card or other payment method accepted by Brent and sign up for a monthly or annual paid subscription or enroll in AutoPay through the Website or the Services, you are expressly agreeing that Brent (or our designated third-party payment processor) is authorized to charge your payment method for the applicable subscription fee or other payment (plus any applicable taxes) on a recurring monthly or annual basis, as applicable. Brent reserves the right to change the terms of your subscription, including price, from time to time, effective as of the beginning of your next billing period following the date of the change. If Brent changes the subscription fee or other charges for your subscription, we will give you advance notice of these changes. If you purchase a subscription from us with promotional pricing, it will renew at our standard non-promotional pricing unless you cancel your subscription prior to renewal (as may also be explained in more detail at the time of your purchase at the promotion pricing).
</p>
<p>
You must cancel your subscription or AutoPay at least twenty-four (24) hours before your next renewal or payment date (as applicable) in order to avoid the next billing (subscription) period. You may cancel your subscription or AutoPay by logging into your Brent account and cancelling it there (if such functionality is provided therein), or you may send us written notice of cancellation to rentpayment@Brent.com specifying that you would like to cancel your subscription for the Services or AutoPay (as applicable). If you cancel your subscription or AutoPay, the cancellation will be effective upon your receipt of confirmation from Brent of the cancellation.
</p>
<b>4. Conditions on Using the Website and the Services</b>
<p>The Website and the Services provide only a neutral online venue which landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers, sub-lessors (collectively, “Listing Parties”) and potential renters can use to find and exchange information in connection with potential transactions involving real estate and, if they choose, to arrange transactions with one another. Brent does not counsel parties to real estate transactions, assess the qualifications of potential tenants, show properties, or negotiate rental or sales contracts on or through the Website or Services. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Website or Services. Additionally, real estate transactions are complicated and are governed by various laws, practices and customs. Users are advised to seek the help of a licensed real estate professional and/or a real estate attorney to help in the negotiation and completion of any real estate transaction.
</p>
<p>
You acknowledge that if you use the Services as a potential renter of a property listed on the Website, including by participating in any offer board for, or by submitting an electronic rental application in relation to, a property listed on the Website, information that you submit through the Website (subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy) will be visible to Listing Parties associated with such property and used by them in assessing your qualifications as a tenant. If you decide to make an offer through the Services to rent any property listed on the Website, you are solely responsible for determining the rental price that you want to offer to a Listing Party for such property. All users should be sure they are comfortable with the price they are offering and be aware of the following:
</p>
<p>
a. the acceptance of your offer by a Listing Party constitutes a binding agreement to enter into a rental agreement with such Listing Party and obligates you to pay all associated fees to Brent and to such Listing Party; and
</p>
<p>
b. you are solely responsible for determining the reasonableness and prudence of any offer you make in light of the property and your circumstances.
</p>
<p>
We have no control over the conduct of our users or the truth or accuracy of the information that users post on the Website. We do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services, whether as renters or Listing Parties. We make no verification of information that any user submits to the Website. We make no representations about properties advertised on the Website, about the Listing Parties responsible for presenting such properties, about the accuracy of information provided by such Listing Parties, or about the financial capabilities of, or the accuracy of information provided by, prospective renters.
</p>
<p>
The Website may from time to time provide the opportunity for you to order, purchase, or receive services from third parties, for example, for the conduct or results of credit, eviction, criminal record, or background checks. You agree that Brent is not a principal, partner, joint venturer or agent (other than for purposes of collection or refund of payments) in connection with the provision of such services, and that you will look solely to such third parties in connection with the provision of such services.
</p>
<p>
Although we may offer features through the Services (including through third-party service providers we engage) which are intended to assist Listing Parties and potential renters to assess the appropriateness of, and to negotiate and consummate transactions among themselves, Brent does not conduct any screening, background investigations or credit checks on any individual's character, creditworthiness or rental history, nor any investigations of the existence or actual state of any property listed. All aspects of transactions between users of the Website and Services, including the existence, quality, safety or legality of the properties advertised, the truth or accuracy of listings, the ability of Listing Parties to rent a property or the ability of renters to pay for rental properties are solely the responsibility of each user and therefore users of the Website and the Services should perform all appropriate due diligence, including visiting in person any listed property, before entering into a rental contract or any other transaction with respect to such property. We strongly discourage renters from sharing sensitive confidential information directly with purported Listing Parties, or wiring funds to such parties, based solely on electronic solicitations from such parties.
</p>
All of the foregoing acknowledgements and conditions apply with equal force to the Brent Select service, which, among other things, enables users to place a 24-hour hold on select properties (the “Select Service”) pursuant to our arrangements with the party or parties controlling such properties. If you submit a “holding deposit” and your rental application is accepted, but you decline to enter into a rental agreement, your holding deposit will be forfeited. If your application is declined or if there are unacceptable conditions, then upon request your holding deposit will be returned. If your application is accepted and you enter into a rental agreement, then you can either apply the holding deposit towards your security deposit or have it refunded upon payment of the security deposit. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Select Service. Additionally, all users of the Select Service should be aware that placing a 24-hour hold on a desired property does not bind the Listing Party, and does not guarantee that you will be the only potential renter permitted to tour the property during such 24-hour period.

</p>
<b>7. Website Policies</b>
<p>
In connection with your use of the Website and Services, you agree that you shall comply with any written policies and procedures for the Website and Services set forth at https://www.Brent.com/terms-of-use.
<br>
Listing Parties and Others Listing Property: You are entitled to list a property for rent ("Property") only if you own the Property, or if you are acting as the managing agent or broker for the Property, or if you have the right to sub-let a Property without violation of the head lease. You may list a Property for as long as the Property remains available for rent. You must promptly remove the Property listing from the Services if it is no longer available for rent. Brent may establish limits on the maximum time that listings will remain on the Services, and Brent shall have no liability or responsibility for the deletion or failure to store any listing. By listing a Property, you represent and warrant to Brent that:
<br>
a. you will provide accurate, current and complete registration and listing information;
<br>
b. your use of the Services will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including without limitation the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and any applicable rent control or rent stabilization laws, and will not violate any contract by which you are bound or any third party rights;
<br>
c. any property that you list on the Services complies fully with all applicable health, safety and fire laws and codes;
<br>
d. in the event you use any feature of the Services provided by a third party service provider which allows you to access a potential renter’s consumer credit data, criminal history or eviction history, you hereby certify that you have a legitimate business need for such data in connection with assessing the suitability of such potential renter as a tenant of a property listed through the Services, that your request and use of such data from such service provider shall be solely for your internal purposes in connection with a potential transaction involving such potential renter, and that you will not provide any such data to any third party; and
<br>
f. without limitation of the foregoing, your listing will comply with the Fair Housing Act and shall not state any discriminatory preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap, or based on any other characteristic prohibited by state or local law.
<br>
</p>
<p>
Renters: You are entitled to provide through the Services electronic rental applications, or offers through offer boards, if any, to Listing Parties with respect to Properties only if you meet any applicable tenant qualifications specified on the Services and you have the bona fide intention to rent the Property if it is offered to you. If your offer to a Listing Party through any such offer board is successful and your rental application, including any electronic rental application submitted through the Services, is approved by the Listing Party, you will be obligated to enter into a lease with such Listing Party and to pay in full any associated deposits to Brent and/or to such Listing Party. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any deposit required and that no negotiation is possible concerning the terms of any rental agreement applicable to a property once the offer board in connection with such property has closed.
<br>
You understand that you may (i) submit electronic instructions through the Services to a Listing Party authorizing such Listing Party to obtain through services provided by one of our third party service providers a copy of your consumer credit report and score, as well as reports of background investigations regarding your criminal and eviction history as each relates to your suitability as a tenant, or (ii) submit consent to a request from a Listing Party that it be authorized to so obtain such credit report and score or background investigation, and that in either case such submission shall constitute written instructions from you for such Listing Party to so obtain a copy of your consumer credit report and score or the results of such background investigation from such provider. Use of each such third-party service may require that you accept additional terms of use. By submitting the instructions or consent described in the preceding sentence, you authorize such Listing Party, once it has obtained your credit report(s) and score(s) and/or the results of such background investigations, to retain, subject to provisions of applicable law, a copy of the same in its records along with the other information you submit to such Listing Party.
</p>
<b>8. Rent Payments and Pay Rent Services</b>
<p>Our “Rent Payments” and “Pay Rent” services (collectively, the “Rent Payment Platform”) enable renters to make rent and other related payments to Listing Parties using functionality made available through the Website and Services. If you are a Listing Party or renter and use the Rent Payment Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Section 8 shall apply to you.
<br>
Brent uses Stripe, a third-party payment platform, to process renters’ credit and debit card transactions and make periodic payments to Listing Parties’ bank accounts that are connected via Stripe Connect. If you are a Listing Party and use our Rent Payment Platform, you expressly understand and agree that Brent shall not be liable to you for our failure to collect fees from renters arising out of any failure of Stripe. The services provided by Stripe are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these Terms of Use or continuing to operate as a Listing Party, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Brent enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Brent accurate and complete information about you and your listings, and you authorize Brent to share with Stripe transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.
<br>
If you are a renter and use our Rent Payment Platform, you agree that if you use a credit or debit card to make a rental payment, Brent may charge you a processing fee in the amount specified at the time of the transaction, which fee will be added to the amount of such rental payment. If any payment you initiate using the Rent Payment Platform does not successfully complete, the applicable Listing Party reserves the right to seek payment from you via or outside the Rent Payment Platform. In addition, your Listing Agent may permit you to opt-in for recurring automatic rent payments. Any authorization you provide to make recurring automatic payments using the Rent Payment Platform will remain in effect until cancelled.

<b>14. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction; Compliance</b><p>
The Website and Services are operated by Brent from the United States, and Brent does not represent or warrant that use of the Website or Services is lawful in other jurisdictions. All matters arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Website or to the use and operation of the Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Without derogation of the obligation to arbitrate set forth in Section 14 below, you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not apply to this Agreement. If you gain access to the Services from locations outside the United States, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of any such other location, and in no event will you use the Services or Site Content in violation of U.S. export laws or regulations.
</p>
<b>15. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.</b>
<br>
<p>
All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) then in effect (for information on the AAA and its rules, see www.adr.org.) and the further procedures set forth herein, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless the Arbitrator shall determine that that venue is not reasonably convenient to all parties, in which case the Arbitrator shall determine another venue that is. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration, and the parties are unable to agree to a substitute, a substitute shall be appointed by the court. The Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any and all remedies authorized by law. The right and obligation to arbitrate under this § 15 shall extend to any claim by or against a party’s officer, director, employee, shareholder, affiliate, agent, or contractor. The arbitrator may render early or summary disposition of any or all issues of fact or law, after the parties have had reasonable opportunity to make submissions on those issues. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 2 et seq. Notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to the contrary, any claims shall be adjudicated on an individual basis only, and YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES THERETO. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may at your option file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court has personal jurisdiction and the case remains in small claims court. Brent does not hereby waive any defense that such jurisdiction may be lacking in your state. Without derogation of the parties’ obligation to arbitrate as set forth herein, for any claims other than those in small claims court, jurisdiction for any court proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be vested exclusively in, and venue shall be laid in, the state or federal courts sitting San Francisco, California except that, following confirmation of an arbitration award in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, a judgment arising therefrom may be executed in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</p>
<b>16. Miscellaneous Provisions</b><p>
No delay or omission by Brent in exercising any of its rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by Brent of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained. As used in this Agreement, "including" means "including but not limited to" If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and Brent regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter. You shall not assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder to any third party.

<b>3. Subscription Information; Payment for Certain Services</b>
To subscribe for certain Services and obtain access to password-protected areas of the Website, you must establish a Brent account by providing us with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the online enrollment form and by selecting a password, the confidentiality of which shall be your responsibility. You may not use anyone else’s Brent account in connection with your use of the Services, or permit anyone else to use the Services or to access password-protected areas of the Website using your Brent account. You agree to notify Brent immediately of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Brent account, or any other breach of security.
<br>
Certain Services may be subject to fees charged by Brent ("Fees") which will be identified at the point of purchase of such Services. Additional functionality and services may be offered or provided by us from time to time and these will be described on the Website. Services requiring Fees which have not been previously agreed upon will be notified to you, and your agreement to be responsible for any such additional Fees will be required, before any such additional Fees will be applied. We will charge your credit card for applicable authorized Fees and you understand that, once charged, such Fees are non-refundable. If Brent does not receive payment from the issuer of the credit card associated with your Brent account, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand directly to Brent, and Brent further reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Brent account and your access to the Services in such circumstances.
<br>
If you purchase a subscription plan or agree to make recurring automatic payments by enrolling in our “AutoPay” service, your subscription or automatic payments will continue in effect and renew on a recurring basis, monthly or annually, unless and until you cancel your subscription or AutoPay. If you provide a credit card or other payment method accepted by Brent and sign up for a monthly or annual paid subscription or enroll in AutoPay through the Website or the Services, you are expressly agreeing that Brent (or our designated third-party payment processor) is authorized to charge your payment method for the applicable subscription fee or other payment (plus any applicable taxes) on a recurring monthly or annual basis, as applicable. Brent reserves the right to change the terms of your subscription, including price, from time to time, effective as of the beginning of your next billing period following the date of the change. If Brent changes the subscription fee or other charges for your subscription, we will give you advance notice of these changes. If you purchase a subscription from us with promotional pricing, it will renew at our standard non-promotional pricing unless you cancel your subscription prior to renewal (as may also be explained in more detail at the time of your purchase at the promotion pricing).
<br>

If you cancel your subscription or AutoPay, the cancellation will be effective upon your receipt of confirmation from Brent of the cancellation.
</p><p>
<b>4. Conditions on Using the Website and the Services</b>
The Website and the Services provide only a neutral online venue which landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers, sub-lessors (collectively, “Listing Parties”) and potential renters can use to find and exchange information in connection with potential transactions involving real estate and, if they choose, to arrange transactions with one another. Brent does not counsel parties to real estate transactions, assess the qualifications of potential tenants, show properties, or negotiate rental or sales contracts on or through the Website or Services. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Website or Services. Additionally, real estate transactions are complicated and are governed by various laws, practices and customs. Users are advised to seek the help of a licensed real estate professional and/or a real estate attorney to help in the negotiation and completion of any real estate transaction.
<br>
You acknowledge that if you use the Services as a potential renter of a property listed on the Website, including by participating in any offer board for, or by submitting an electronic rental application in relation to, a property listed on the Website, information that you submit through the Website (subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy) will be visible to Listing Parties associated with such property and used by them in assessing your qualifications as a tenant. If you decide to make an offer through the Services to rent any property listed on the Website, you are solely responsible for determining the rental price that you want to offer to a Listing Party for such property. All users should be sure they are comfortable with the price they are offering and be aware of the following:
<br>
a. the acceptance of your offer by a Listing Party constitutes a binding agreement to enter into a rental agreement with such Listing Party and obligates you to pay all associated fees to Brent and to such Listing Party; and
<br>
b. you are solely responsible for determining the reasonableness and prudence of any offer you make in light of the property and your circumstances.
<br>
We have no control over the conduct of our users or the truth or accuracy of the information that users post on the Website. We do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services, whether as renters or Listing Parties. We make no verification of information that any user submits to the Website. We make no representations about properties advertised on the Website, about the Listing Parties responsible for presenting such properties, about the accuracy of information provided by such Listing Parties, or about the financial capabilities of, or the accuracy of information provided by, prospective renters.
<br>
The Website may from time to time provide the opportunity for you to order, purchase, or receive services from third parties, for example, for the conduct or results of credit, eviction, criminal record, or background checks. You agree that Brent is not a principal, partner, joint venturer or agent (other than for purposes of collection or refund of payments) in connection with the provision of such services, and that you will look solely to such third parties in connection with the provision of such services.
<br>
Although we may offer features through the Services (including through third-party service providers we engage) which are intended to assist Listing Parties and potential renters to assess the appropriateness of, and to negotiate and consummate transactions among themselves, Brent does not conduct any screening, background investigations or credit checks on any individual's character, creditworthiness or rental history, nor any investigations of the existence or actual state of any property listed. All aspects of transactions between users of the Website and Services, including the existence, quality, safety or legality of the properties advertised, the truth or accuracy of listings, the ability of Listing Parties to rent a property or the ability of renters to pay for rental properties are solely the responsibility of each user and therefore users of the Website and the Services should perform all appropriate due diligence, including visiting in person any listed property, before entering into a rental contract or any other transaction with respect to such property. We strongly discourage renters from sharing sensitive confidential information directly with purported Listing Parties, or wiring funds to such parties, based solely on electronic solicitations from such parties.
<br>
All of the foregoing acknowledgements and conditions apply with equal force to the Brent Select service, which, among other things, enables users to place a 24-hour hold on select properties (the “Select Service”) pursuant to our arrangements with the party or parties controlling such properties. If you submit a “holding deposit” and your rental application is accepted, but you decline to enter into a rental agreement, your holding deposit will be forfeited. If your application is declined or if there are unacceptable conditions, then upon request your holding deposit will be returned. If your application is accepted and you enter into a rental agreement, then you can either apply the holding deposit towards your security deposit or have it refunded upon payment of the security deposit. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Select Service. Additionally, all users of the Select Service should be aware that placing a 24-hour hold on a desired property does not bind the Listing Party, and does not guarantee that you will be the only potential renter permitted to tour the property during such 24-hour period.

<b>7. Website Policies</b>
In connection with your use of the Website and Services, you agree that you shall comply with any written policies and procedures for the Website and Services set forth at 

Listing Parties and Others Listing Property: You are entitled to list a property for rent ("Property") only if you own the Property, or if you are acting as the managing agent or broker for the Property, or if you have the right to sub-let a Property without violation of the head lease. You may list a Property for as long as the Property remains available for rent. You must promptly remove the Property listing from the Services if it is no longer available for rent. Brent may establish limits on the maximum time that listings will remain on the Services, and Brent shall have no liability or responsibility for the deletion or failure to store any listing. By listing a Property, you represent and warrant to Brent that:
<br>
a. you will provide accurate, current and complete registration and listing information;
<br>
b. your use of the Services will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including without limitation the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and any applicable rent control or rent stabilization laws, and will not violate any contract by which you are bound or any third party rights;
<br>
c. any property that you list on the Services complies fully with all applicable health, safety and fire laws and codes;
<br>
d. in the event you use any feature of the Services provided by a third party service provider which allows you to access a potential renter’s consumer credit data, criminal history or eviction history, you hereby certify that you have a legitimate business need for such data in connection with assessing the suitability of such potential renter as a tenant of a property listed through the Services, that your request and use of such data from such service provider shall be solely for your internal purposes in connection with a potential transaction involving such potential renter, and that you will not provide any such data to any third party; and
<br>
f. without limitation of the foregoing, your listing will comply with the Fair Housing Act and shall not state any discriminatory preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap, or based on any other characteristic prohibited by state or local law.
<br>
Renters: You are entitled to provide through the Services electronic rental applications, or offers through offer boards, if any, to Listing Parties with respect to Properties only if you meet any applicable tenant qualifications specified on the Services and you have the bona fide intention to rent the Property if it is offered to you. If your offer to a Listing Party through any such offer board is successful and your rental application, including any electronic rental application submitted through the Services, is approved by the Listing Party, you will be obligated to enter into a lease with such Listing Party and to pay in full any associated deposits to Brent and/or to such Listing Party. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any deposit required and that no negotiation is possible concerning the terms of any rental agreement applicable to a property once the offer board in connection with such property has closed.
<br>
You understand that you may (i) submit electronic instructions through the Services to a Listing Party authorizing such Listing Party to obtain through services provided by one of our third party service providers a copy of your consumer credit report and score, as well as reports of background investigations regarding your criminal and eviction history as each relates to your suitability as a tenant, or (ii) submit consent to a request from a Listing Party that it be authorized to so obtain such credit report and score or background investigation, and that in either case such submission shall constitute written instructions from you for such Listing Party to so obtain a copy of your consumer credit report and score or the results of such background investigation from such provider. Use of each such third-party service may require that you accept additional terms of use. By submitting the instructions or consent described in the preceding sentence, you authorize such Listing Party, once it has obtained your credit report(s) and score(s) and/or the results of such background investigations, to retain, subject to provisions of applicable law, a copy of the same in its records along with the other information you submit to such Listing Party.
<br>
<b>8. Rent Payments and Pay Rent Services</b>
<br>
Our “Rent Payments” and “Pay Rent” services (collectively, the “Rent Payment Platform”) enable renters to make rent and other related payments to Listing Parties using functionality made available through the Website and Services. If you are a Listing Party or renter and use the Rent Payment Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Section 8 shall apply to you.
<br>
Brent uses Stripe, a third-party payment platform, to process renters’ credit and debit card transactions and make periodic payments to Listing Parties’ bank accounts that are connected via Stripe Connect. If you are a Listing Party and use our Rent Payment Platform, you expressly understand and agree that Brent shall not be liable to you for our failure to collect fees from renters arising out of any failure of Stripe. The services provided by Stripe are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these Terms of Use or continuing to operate as a Listing Party, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Brent enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Brent accurate and complete information about you and your listings, and you authorize Brent to share with Stripe transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.
<br>
If you are a renter and use our Rent Payment Platform, you agree that if you use a credit or debit card to make a rental payment, Brent may charge you a processing fee in the amount specified at the time of the transaction, which fee will be added to the amount of such rental payment. If any payment you initiate using the Rent Payment Platform does not successfully complete, the applicable Listing Party reserves the right to seek payment from you via or outside the Rent Payment Platform. In addition, your Listing Agent may permit you to opt-in for recurring automatic rent payments. Any authorization you provide to make recurring automatic payments using the Rent Payment Platform will remain in effect until cancelled.
<br>
<b>9. Services Restrictions</b>

<br>
a. Infringe the rights of any person or entity, including without limitation by offering to lease a property without the rights to do so;

13. Release; Indemnification
BY USING THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL REMEDY OR LIABILITY YOU SEEK TO OBTAIN FOR ACTIONS OR OMISSIONS OF OTHER USERS WILL BE LIMITED TO A CLAIM AGAINST THE PARTICULAR USER OR USERS WHO CAUSED YOU HARM. IN THE EVENT THAT YOU HAVE A DISPUTE WITH ONE OR MORE OTHER USERS OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN USERS REGARDING ANY POTENTIAL OR CONSUMMATED TRANSACTION), AND IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR PROVISION OF THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE TO RELEASE, REMISE AND FOREVER DISCHARGE Brent AND EACH OF ITS AGENTS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND ALL OTHER RELATED PERSONS OR ENTITIES FROM ANY AND ALL MANNER OF RIGHTS, CLAIMS, COMPLAINTS, DEMANDS, CAUSES OF ACTION, PROCEEDINGS, LIABLITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LEGAL FEES, COSTS, AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, WHICH NOW OR HEREAFTER ARISE FROM, RELATE TO, OR ARE CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTE AND/OR YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE OR SERVICES. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH SAYS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD Brent (AND EACH OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES) HARMLESS FROM ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, DAMAGE, LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ALLEGING FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT, IF TRUE, COULD CONSTITUTE YOUR BREACH OF ANY OF THESE TERMS. WE WILL CONTROL ANY SUCH DEFENSE AND RELATED SETTLEMENT AND YOU AGREE TO REASONABLY ASSIST US THEREWITH AT YOUR EXPENSE.

14. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction; Compliance
The Website and Services are operated by Brent from the United States, and Brent does not represent or warrant that use of the Website or Services is lawful in other jurisdictions. All matters arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Website or to the use and operation of the Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Without derogation of the obligation to arbitrate set forth in Section 14 below, you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not apply to this Agreement. If you gain access to the Services from locations outside the United States, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of any such other location, and in no event will you use the Services or Site Content in violation of U.S. export laws or regulations.

15. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.
All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) then in effect (for information on the AAA and its rules, see www.adr.org.) and the further procedures set forth herein, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless the Arbitrator shall determine that that venue is not reasonably convenient to all parties, in which case the Arbitrator shall determine another venue that is. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration, and the parties are unable to agree to a substitute, a substitute shall be appointed by the court. The Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any and all remedies authorized by law. The right and obligation to arbitrate under this § 15 shall extend to any claim by or against a party’s officer, director, employee, shareholder, affiliate, agent, or contractor. The arbitrator may render early or summary disposition of any or all issues of fact or law, after the parties have had reasonable opportunity to make submissions on those issues. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 2 et seq. Notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to the contrary, any claims shall be adjudicated on an individual basis only, and YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES THERETO. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may at your option file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court has personal jurisdiction and the case remains in small claims court. Brent does not hereby waive any defense that such jurisdiction may be lacking in your state. Without derogation of the parties’ obligation to arbitrate as set forth herein, for any claims other than those in small claims court, jurisdiction for any court proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be vested exclusively in, and venue shall be laid in, the state or federal courts sitting San Francisco, California except that, following confirmation of an arbitration award in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, a judgment arising therefrom may be executed in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
<b>16. Miscellaneous Provisions</b>
No delay or omission by Brent in exercising any of its rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by Brent of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained. As used in this Agreement, "including" means "including but not limited to" If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and Brent regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.

<b>3. Subscription Information; Payment for Certain Services</b>
<br>
To subscribe for certain Services and obtain access to password-protected areas of the Website, you must establish a Brent account by providing us with current, complete and accurate information as prompted by the online enrollment form and by selecting a password, the confidentiality of which shall be your responsibility. You may not use anyone else’s Brent account in connection with your use of the Services, or permit anyone else to use the Services or to access password-protected areas of the Website using your Brent account. You agree to notify Brent immediately of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your Brent account, or any other breach of security.
<br>
Certain Services may be subject to fees charged by Brent ("Fees") which will be identified at the point of purchase of such Services. Additional functionality and services may be offered or provided by us from time to time and these will be described on the Website. Services requiring Fees which have not been previously agreed upon will be notified to you, and your agreement to be responsible for any such additional Fees will be required, before any such additional Fees will be applied. We will charge your credit card for applicable authorized Fees and you understand that, once charged, such Fees are non-refundable. If Brent does not receive payment from the issuer of the credit card associated with your Brent account, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand directly to Brent, and Brent further reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Brent account and your access to the Services in such circumstances.
<br>
If you purchase a subscription plan or agree to make recurring automatic payments by enrolling in our “AutoPay” service, your subscription or automatic payments will continue in effect and renew on a recurring basis, monthly or annually, unless and until you cancel your subscription or AutoPay. If you provide a credit card or other payment method accepted by Brent and sign up for a monthly or annual paid subscription or enroll in AutoPay through the Website or the Services, you are expressly agreeing that Brent (or our designated third-party payment processor) is authorized to charge your payment method for the applicable subscription fee or other payment (plus any applicable taxes) on a recurring monthly or annual basis, as applicable. Brent reserves the right to change the terms of your subscription, including price, from time to time, effective as of the beginning of your next billing period following the date of the change.

If you purchase a subscription from us with promotional pricing, it will renew at our standard non-promotional pricing unless you cancel your subscription prior to renewal (as may also be explained in more detail at the time of your purchase at the promotion pricing).
<br>
You must cancel your subscription or AutoPay at least twenty-four (24) hours before your next renewal or payment date (as applicable) in order to avoid the next billing (subscription) period. You may cancel your subscription or AutoPay by logging into your Brent account and cancelling it there (if such functionality is provided therein), or you may send us written notice of cancellation to rentpayment@Brent.com specifying that you would like to cancel your subscription for the Services or AutoPay (as applicable). If you cancel your subscription or AutoPay, the cancellation will be effective upon your receipt of confirmation from Brent of the cancellation.
<br>
<b>4. Conditions on Using the Website and the Services</b>
The Website and the Services provide only a neutral online venue which landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers, sub-lessors (collectively, “Listing Parties”) and potential renters can use to find and exchange information in connection with potential transactions involving real estate and, if they choose, to arrange transactions with one another. Brent does not counsel parties to real estate transactions, assess the qualifications of potential tenants, show properties, or negotiate rental or sales contracts on or through the Website or Services. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Website or Services. Additionally, real estate transactions are complicated and are governed by various laws, practices and customs. Users are advised to seek the help of a licensed real estate professional and/or a real estate attorney to help in the negotiation and completion of any real estate transaction.
<br>
You acknowledge that if you use the Services as a potential renter of a property listed on the Website, including by participating in any offer board for, or by submitting an electronic rental application in relation to, a property listed on the Website, information that you submit through the Website (subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy) will be visible to Listing Parties associated with such property and used by them in assessing your qualifications as a tenant. If you decide to make an offer through the Services to rent any property listed on the Website, you are solely responsible for determining the rental price that you want to offer to a Listing Party for such property. All users should be sure they are comfortable with the price they are offering and be aware of the following:
<br>
a. the acceptance of your offer by a Listing Party constitutes a binding agreement to enter into a rental agreement with such Listing Party and obligates you to pay all associated fees to Brent and to such Listing Party; and
<br>
b. you are solely responsible for determining the reasonableness and prudence of any offer you make in light of the property and your circumstances.
<br>
We have no control over the conduct of our users or the truth or accuracy of the information that users post on the Website. We do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services, whether as renters or Listing Parties. We make no verification of information that any user submits to the Website. We make no representations about properties advertised on the Website, about the Listing Parties responsible for presenting such properties, about the accuracy of information provided by such Listing Parties, or about the financial capabilities of, or the accuracy of information provided by, prospective renters.
<br>
The Website may from time to time provide the opportunity for you to order, purchase, or receive services from third parties, for example, for the conduct or results of credit, eviction, criminal record, or background checks. You agree that Brent is not a principal, partner, joint venturer or agent (other than for purposes of collection or refund of payments) in connection with the provision of such services, and that you will look solely to such third parties in connection with the provision of such services.
<br>
Although we may offer features through the Services (including through third-party service providers we engage) which are intended to assist Listing Parties and potential renters to assess the appropriateness of, and to negotiate and consummate transactions among themselves, Brent does not conduct any screening, background investigations or credit checks on any individual's character, creditworthiness or rental history, nor any investigations of the existence or actual state of any property listed. All aspects of transactions between users of the Website and Services, including the existence, quality, safety or legality of the properties advertised, the truth or accuracy of listings, the ability of Listing Parties to rent a property or the ability of renters to pay for rental properties are solely the responsibility of each user and therefore users of the Website and the Services should perform all appropriate due diligence, including visiting in person any listed property, before entering into a rental contract or any other transaction with respect to such property. We strongly discourage renters from sharing sensitive confidential information directly with purported Listing Parties, or wiring funds to such parties, based solely on electronic solicitations from such parties.
<br>
All of the foregoing acknowledgements and conditions apply with equal force to the Brent Select service, which, among other things, enables users to place a 24-hour hold on select properties (the “Select Service”) pursuant to our arrangements with the party or parties controlling such properties. If you submit a “holding deposit” and your rental application is accepted, but you decline to enter into a rental agreement, your holding deposit will be forfeited. If your application is declined or if there are unacceptable conditions, then upon request your holding deposit will be returned. If your application is accepted and you enter into a rental agreement, then you can either apply the holding deposit towards your security deposit or have it refunded upon payment of the security deposit. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Select Service. Additionally, all users of the Select Service should be aware that placing a 24-hour hold on a desired property does not bind the Listing Party, and does not guarantee that you will be the only potential renter permitted to tour the property during such 24-hour period.

c. to delete from any listing or edit any falsehoods, inconsistencies, offensive material or any material that infringes third party rights or that is otherwise in breach of these Terms.

<b>7. Website Policies</b>
In connection with your use of the Website and Services, you agree that you shall comply with any written policies and procedures for the Website and Services set forth at https://www.Brent.com/terms-of-use.

Listing Parties and Others Listing Property: You are entitled to list a property for rent ("Property") only if you own the Property, or if you are acting as the managing agent or broker for the Property, or if you have the right to sub-let a Property without violation of the head lease. You may list a Property for as long as the Property remains available for rent. You must promptly remove the Property listing from the Services if it is no longer available for rent. Brent may establish limits on the maximum time that listings will remain on the Services, and Brent shall have no liability or responsibility for the deletion or failure to store any listing. By listing a Property, you represent and warrant to Brent that:

a. you will provide accurate, current and complete registration and listing information;

b. your use of the Services will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including without limitation the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and any applicable rent control or rent stabilization laws, and will not violate any contract by which you are bound or any third party rights;

c. any property that you list on the Services complies fully with all applicable health, safety and fire laws and codes;

d. in the event you use any feature of the Services provided by a third party service provider which allows you to access a potential renter’s consumer credit data, criminal history or eviction history, you hereby certify that you have a legitimate business need for such data in connection with assessing the suitability of such potential renter as a tenant of a property listed through the Services, that your request and use of such data from such service provider shall be solely for your internal purposes in connection with a potential transaction involving such potential renter, and that you will not provide any such data to any third party; and

f. without limitation of the foregoing, your listing will comply with the Fair Housing Act and shall not state any discriminatory preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap, or based on any other characteristic prohibited by state or local law.

<b>Renters</b>You are entitled to provide through the Services electronic rental applications, or offers through offer boards, if any, to Listing Parties with respect to Properties only if you meet any applicable tenant qualifications specified on the Services and you have the bona fide intention to rent the Property if it is offered to you. If your offer to a Listing Party through any such offer board is successful and your rental application, including any electronic rental application submitted through the Services, is approved by the Listing Party, you will be obligated to enter into a lease with such Listing Party and to pay in full any associated deposits to Brent and/or to such Listing Party. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any deposit required and that no negotiation is possible concerning the terms of any rental agreement applicable to a property once the offer board in connection with such property has closed.

You understand that you may (i) submit electronic instructions through the Services to a Listing Party authorizing such Listing Party to obtain through services provided by one of our third party service providers a copy of your consumer credit report and score, as well as reports of background investigations regarding your criminal and eviction history as each relates to your suitability as a tenant, or (ii) submit consent to a request from a Listing Party that it be authorized to so obtain such credit report and score or background investigation, and that in either case such submission shall constitute written instructions from you for such Listing Party to so obtain a copy of your consumer credit report and score or the results of such background investigation from such provider. Use of each such third-party service may require that you accept additional terms of use. By submitting the instructions or consent described in the preceding sentence, you authorize such Listing Party, once it has obtained your credit report(s) and score(s) and/or the results of such background investigations, to retain, subject to provisions of applicable law, a copy of the same in its records along with the other information you submit to such Listing Party.

<b>8. Rent Payments and Pay Rent Services</b>
Our “Rent Payments” and “Pay Rent” services (collectively, the “Rent Payment Platform”) enable renters to make rent and other related payments to Listing Parties using functionality made available through the Website and Services. If you are a Listing Party or renter and use the Rent Payment Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Section 8 shall apply to you.

Brent uses Stripe, a third-party payment platform, to process renters’ credit and debit card transactions and make periodic payments to Listing Parties’ bank accounts that are connected via Stripe Connect. If you are a Listing Party and use our Rent Payment Platform, you expressly understand and agree that Brent shall not be liable to you for our failure to collect fees from renters arising out of any failure of Stripe. The services provided by Stripe are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these Terms of Use or continuing to operate as a Listing Party, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Brent enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Brent accurate and complete information about you and your listings, and you authorize Brent to share with Stripe transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

If you are a renter and use our Rent Payment Platform, you agree that if you use a credit or debit card to make a rental payment, Brent may charge you a processing fee in the amount specified at the time of the transaction, which fee will be added to the amount of such rental payment. If any payment you initiate using the Rent Payment Platform does not successfully complete, the applicable Listing Party reserves the right to seek payment from you via or outside the Rent Payment Platform. In addition, your Listing Agent may permit you to opt-in for recurring automatic rent payments. Any authorization you provide to make recurring automatic payments using the Rent Payment Platform will remain in effect until cancelled.

<b>14. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction; Compliance</b>
<br>
The Website and Services are operated by Brent from the United States, and Brent does not represent or warrant that use of the Website or Services is lawful in other jurisdictions. All matters arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Website or to the use and operation of the Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Without derogation of the obligation to arbitrate set forth in Section 14 below, you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California.

<br>
<b>15. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.</b>
All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) then in effect (for information on the AAA and its rules, see www.adr.org.) and the further procedures set forth herein, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless the Arbitrator shall determine that that venue is not reasonably convenient to all parties, in which case the Arbitrator shall determine another venue that is. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration, and the parties are unable to agree to a substitute, a substitute shall be appointed by the court. The Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any and all remedies authorized by law. The right and obligation to arbitrate under this § 15 shall extend to any claim by or against a party’s officer, director, employee, shareholder, affiliate, agent, or contractor. The arbitrator may render early or summary disposition of any or all issues of fact or law, after the parties have had reasonable opportunity to make submissions on those issues. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 2 et seq. Notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to the contrary, any claims shall be adjudicated on an individual basis only, and YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES THERETO. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may at your option file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court has personal jurisdiction and the case remains in small claims court. Brent does not hereby waive any defense that such jurisdiction may be lacking in your state. Without derogation of the parties’ obligation to arbitrate as set forth herein, for any claims other than those in small claims court, jurisdiction for any court proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be vested exclusively in, and venue shall be laid in, the state or federal courts sitting San Francisco, California except that, following confirmation of an arbitration award in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, a judgment arising therefrom may be executed in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
<b>16. Miscellaneous Provisions</b>
<br>
No delay or omission by Brent in exercising any of its rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by Brent of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained. As used in this Agreement, "including" means "including but not limited to" If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and Brent regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.

<b>4. Conditions on Using the Website and the Services</b>
<br>
The Website and the Services provide only a neutral online venue which landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property managers, sub-lessors (collectively, “Listing Parties”) and potential renters can use to find and exchange information in connection with potential transactions involving real estate and, if they choose, to arrange transactions with one another. Brent does not counsel parties to real estate transactions, assess the qualifications of potential tenants, show properties, or negotiate rental or sales contracts on or through the Website or Services. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Website or Services. Additionally, real estate transactions are complicated and are governed by various laws, practices and customs. Users are advised to seek the help of a licensed real estate professional and/or a real estate attorney to help in the negotiation and completion of any real estate transaction.
<br>
You acknowledge that if you use the Services as a potential renter of a property listed on the Website, including by participating in any offer board for, or by submitting an electronic rental application in relation to, a property listed on the Website, information that you submit through the Website (subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy) will be visible to Listing Parties associated with such property and used by them in assessing your qualifications as a tenant. If you decide to make an offer through the Services to rent any property listed on the Website, you are solely responsible for determining the rental price that you want to offer to a Listing Party for such property. All users should be sure they are comfortable with the price they are offering and be aware of the following:
<br>
a. the acceptance of your offer by a Listing Party constitutes a binding agreement to enter into a rental agreement with such Listing Party and obligates you to pay all associated fees to Brent and to such Listing Party; and
<br>
b. you are solely responsible for determining the reasonableness and prudence of any offer you make in light of the property and your circumstances.
<br>
We have no control over the conduct of our users or the truth or accuracy of the information that users post on the Website. We do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services, whether as renters or Listing Parties. We make no verification of information that any user submits to the Website. We make no representations about properties advertised on the Website, about the Listing Parties responsible for presenting such properties, about the accuracy of information provided by such Listing Parties, or about the financial capabilities of, or the accuracy of information provided by, prospective renters.
<br>
The Website may from time to time provide the opportunity for you to order, purchase, or receive services from third parties, for example, for the conduct or results of credit, eviction, criminal record, or background checks. You agree that Brent is not a principal, partner, joint venturer or agent (other than for purposes of collection or refund of payments) in connection with the provision of such services, and that you will look solely to such third parties in connection with the provision of such services.
<br>
Although we may offer features through the Services (including through third-party service providers we engage) which are intended to assist Listing Parties and potential renters to assess the appropriateness of, and to negotiate and consummate transactions among themselves, Brent does not conduct any screening, background investigations or credit checks on any individual's character, creditworthiness or rental history, nor any investigations of the existence or actual state of any property listed. All aspects of transactions between users of the Website and Services, including the existence, quality, safety or legality of the properties advertised, the truth or accuracy of listings, the ability of Listing Parties to rent a property or the ability of renters to pay for rental properties are solely the responsibility of each user and therefore users of the Website and the Services should perform all appropriate due diligence, including visiting in person any listed property, before entering into a rental contract or any other transaction with respect to such property. We strongly discourage renters from sharing sensitive confidential information directly with purported Listing Parties, or wiring funds to such parties, based solely on electronic solicitations from such parties.
<br>
All of the foregoing acknowledgements and conditions apply with equal force to the Brent Select service, which, among other things, enables users to place a 24-hour hold on select properties (the “Select Service”) pursuant to our arrangements with the party or parties controlling such properties. If you submit a “holding deposit” and your rental application is accepted, but you decline to enter into a rental agreement, your holding deposit will be forfeited. If your application is declined or if there are unacceptable conditions, then upon request your holding deposit will be returned. If your application is accepted and you enter into a rental agreement, then you can either apply the holding deposit towards your security deposit or have it refunded upon payment of the security deposit. No brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created between Brent and any user of the Select Service. Additionally, all users of the Select Service should be aware that placing a 24-hour hold on a desired property does not bind the Listing Party, and does not guarantee that you will be the only potential renter permitted to tour the property during such 24-hour period.

<b>7. Website Policies</b>
In connection with your use of the Website and Services, you agree that you shall comply with any written policies and procedures for the Website and Services set forth at https://www.Brent.com/terms-of-use.
<<br>
Listing Parties and Others Listing Property: You are entitled to list a property for rent ("Property") only if you own the Property, or if you are acting as the managing agent or broker for the Property, or if you have the right to sub-let a Property without violation of the head lease. You may list a Property for as long as the Property remains available for rent. You must promptly remove the Property listing from the Services if it is no longer available for rent. Brent may establish limits on the maximum time that listings will remain on the Services, and Brent shall have no liability or responsibility for the deletion or failure to store any listing. By listing a Property, you represent and warrant to Brent that:
<br>
a. you will provide accurate, current and complete registration and listing information;
<br>
b. your use of the Services will comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including without limitation the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and any applicable rent control or rent stabilization laws, and will not violate any contract by which you are bound or any third party rights;
<br>
c. any property that you list on the Services complies fully with all applicable health, safety and fire laws and codes;
<br>
d. in the event you use any feature of the Services provided by a third party service provider which allows you to access a potential renter’s consumer credit data, criminal history or eviction history, you hereby certify that you have a legitimate business need for such data in connection with assessing the suitability of such potential renter as a tenant of a property listed through the Services, that your request and use of such data from such service provider shall be solely for your internal purposes in connection with a potential transaction involving such potential renter, and that you will not provide any such data to any third party; and
<br>
f. without limitation of the foregoing, your listing will comply with the Fair Housing Act and shall not state any discriminatory preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or handicap, or based on any other characteristic prohibited by state or local law.
<br>
Renters: You are entitled to provide through the Services electronic rental applications, or offers through offer boards, if any, to Listing Parties with respect to Properties only if you meet any applicable tenant qualifications specified on the Services and you have the bona fide intention to rent the Property if it is offered to you. If your offer to a Listing Party through any such offer board is successful and your rental application, including any electronic rental application submitted through the Services, is approved by the Listing Party, you will be obligated to enter into a lease with such Listing Party and to pay in full any associated deposits to Brent and/or to such Listing Party. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the payment of any deposit required and that no negotiation is possible concerning the terms of any rental agreement applicable to a property once the offer board in connection with such property has closed.
<br>
You understand that you may (i) submit electronic instructions through the Services to a Listing Party authorizing such Listing Party to obtain through services provided by one of our third party service providers a copy of your consumer credit report and score, as well as reports of background investigations regarding your criminal and eviction history as each relates to your suitability as a tenant, or (ii) submit consent to a request from a Listing Party that it be authorized to so obtain such credit report and score or background investigation, and that in either case such submission shall constitute written instructions from you for such Listing Party to so obtain a copy of your consumer credit report and score or the results of such background investigation from such provider. Use of each such third-party service may require that you accept additional terms of use. By submitting the instructions or consent described in the preceding sentence, you authorize such Listing Party, once it has obtained your credit report(s) and score(s) and/or the results of such background investigations, to retain, subject to provisions of applicable law, a copy of the same in its records along with the other information you submit to such Listing Party.

<b>8. Rent Payments and Pay Rent Services</b>
Our “Rent Payments” and “Pay Rent” services (collectively, the “Rent Payment Platform”) enable renters to make rent and other related payments to Listing Parties using functionality made available through the Website and Services. If you are a Listing Party or renter and use the Rent Payment Platform, you acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Section 8 shall apply to you.
<br>
Brent uses Stripe, a third-party payment platform, to process renters’ credit and debit card transactions and make periodic payments to Listing Parties’ bank accounts that are connected via Stripe Connect. If you are a Listing Party and use our Rent Payment Platform, you expressly understand and agree that Brent shall not be liable to you for our failure to collect fees from renters arising out of any failure of Stripe. The services provided by Stripe are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these Terms of Use or continuing to operate as a Listing Party, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Brent enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Brent accurate and complete information about you and your listings, and you authorize Brent to share with Stripe transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.
<br>
If you are a renter and use our Rent Payment Platform, you agree that if you use a credit or debit card to make a rental payment, Brent may charge you a processing fee in the amount specified at the time of the transaction, which fee will be added to the amount of such rental payment. If any payment you initiate using the Rent Payment Platform does not successfully complete, the applicable Listing Party reserves the right to seek payment from you via or outside the Rent Payment Platform. In addition, your Listing Agent may permit you to opt-in for recurring automatic rent payments. Any authorization you provide to make recurring automatic payments using the Rent Payment Platform will remain in effect until cancelled.
<br>

<b>14. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction; Compliance</b>
The Website and Services are operated by Brent from the United States, and Brent does not represent or warrant that use of the Website or Services is lawful in other jurisdictions. All matters arising from or relating to this Agreement, the Website or to the use and operation of the Services shall be governed by the substantive laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Without derogation of the obligation to arbitrate set forth in Section 14 below, you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act shall not apply to this Agreement. If you gain access to the Services from locations outside the United States, you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of any such other location, and in no event will you use the Services or Site Content in violation of U.S. export laws or regulations.
<br>
<b>15. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.</b>
All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) then in effect (for information on the AAA and its rules, see www.adr.org.) and the further procedures set forth herein, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless the Arbitrator shall determine that that venue is not reasonably convenient to all parties, in which case the Arbitrator shall determine another venue that is. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration, and the parties are unable to agree to a substitute, a substitute shall be appointed by the court. The Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any and all remedies authorized by law. The right and obligation to arbitrate under this § 15 shall extend to any claim by or against a party’s officer, director, employee, shareholder, affiliate, agent, or contractor. The arbitrator may render early or summary disposition of any or all issues of fact or law, after the parties have had reasonable opportunity to make submissions on those issues. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 2 et seq. Notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to the contrary, any claims shall be adjudicated on an individual basis only, and YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES THERETO. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Arbitrator shall determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may at your option file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if such court has personal jurisdiction and the case remains in small claims court. Brent does not hereby waive any defense that such jurisdiction may be lacking in your state. Without derogation of the parties’ obligation to arbitrate as set forth herein, for any claims other than those in small claims court, jurisdiction for any court proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the Services shall be vested exclusively in, and venue shall be laid in, the state or federal courts sitting San Francisco, California except that, following confirmation of an arbitration award in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, a judgment arising therefrom may be executed in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
<b>16. Miscellaneous Provisions</b>
No delay or omission by Brent in exercising any of its rights occurring upon any noncompliance or default by you with respect to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver thereof, and a waiver by Brent of any of the covenants, conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained. As used in this Agreement, "including" means "including but not limited to" If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and Brent regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.
